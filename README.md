# khalkeon

## About this project

Khalkeon is a tool designed to streamline and automate the process of merging multiple [coreos ignitions](github.com/coreos/ignition). It ensures that the resulting configurations are consistent, valid, and ready for deployment.

## Requirements and Setup

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.23.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/khalkeon:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified. 
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment. 
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/khalkeon:tag
```

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

**Validate ignition was created successfully**
You can check the result of ignitions merging in the secret data:

```sh
kubectl get secret target --template={{.data.config}} | base64 --decode | jq .
```

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```
